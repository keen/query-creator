## Build

The `@keen.io/query-creator` use two step build to address issues with CSS specificity.

##### Typescript

First stage is responsible for transpilation Typescript code to `esnext` and emiting type declarations.

##### Babel

Second stage is responsible for code transpilation based on supported browserlist defined in `package.json` file and increasing `styled-components` css specificity by using plugins from `.babelrc` file.
Generator functions transformations are disabled so applications that use this package should take care of it on their own.
